  <h2>Legal info</h2>

<p>
Hello!  This is legal information.  I believe that I am perfectly within my rights to provide this site.  The grade distribution data is crawled from <a href="https://musis1.missouri.edu/gradedist/mu_grade_dist_intro.cfm#CGI.script.name#">here</a>.  I am getting my rights information from the <a href="http://www.missouri.edu/copyright.php">copyright notice</a> linked at the bottom of that page.  I have included a copy of the Copyright and Disclaimer Statement below as it was when I originally read it.  Because of #2, I am allowed to print and reproduce the data from the grade distribution site as long as I state where it is from (which I did).  

</p>
<p>Hopefully that satisfies everything! :)  If there is any breach of any weird Mizzou rule, please let me know and I will immediately fix the issue.  I can be contacted at rzeg24@gmail.com.</p>
